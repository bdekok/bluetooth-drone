# Bluetooth drone

Small React App that uses [Web Bluetooth](https://caniuse.com/#search=web%20bluetooth) to control a Parrot minidrone in combination with a PS4 controller (wired). 

*Please note that the firmware of the Parrot Minidrone has to be on 2.1.7 for now, and not on the latest firmware (2.6.8).*
